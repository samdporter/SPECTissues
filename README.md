# SPECTissues
- Memory leak when CIL algorithm run
- See minimal.py for working .py script
- see minimalCIL for failing .py script (inc working OSEM) - this runs with OpenMP switched off
- valgrind run and log file available

- Run with sirf cmake build + CIL conda build

# ALL fixed with STIR PR #1169
- repo altered to demonstrate fix for SIRF and STIR with OSEM
